Canons with fps view, sm64 or smb style
Canon ideas:
Using waypoints towards where the canon is facing so the trajectory is always the same then use transform.translate, kinda like the camera
Rotate waypoints with canon
Canon can go up/down/left/right
FPS view with the camera seeing what the play is, so make the player always face exterior of canon
