Audio
	Marble rolling, hitting, etc noises
	Background music so the player isn't bored
	I can't manipulate audio

Water mill looking thing
	It spins when you go through it
	Just looks cool

Bonus levels
	Tiltable terrains where the player can't directly control itself, but can move the terrain's tilt
	I need a flipper level too, that just sounds too fun
		Perhaps also with a score to reach

Tunnels (Or retextured rails, lol)
	Literally just retexture rails

Angled rails
	I'll probably have to use a bunch of square and create them using maths
	Why does unity only suppot base shapes

Coins
	Neat
	Makes  the player happy to collect things

Score
	Works with coins
	Perhaps with time completion too

Mobile support
	Joystick on screen
	Left and right buttons for camera

Replace death particles by shattered marble
	I don't know anything about 3d modeling
	help

Gravity change SMG style using ramps 
	Good luck with that me
	Really sound complicated

Level select
	After selecting play
	Frames with level image in the middle
	Background is marbles going through rails

Canons with fps view, sm64 or smb style
	Using waypoints towards where the canon is facing so the trajectory is always the same then use transform.translate, kinda like the camera
	Rotate waypoints with canon
	Canon can go up/down/left/right
	FPS view with the camera seeing what the play is, so make the player always face exterior of canon
